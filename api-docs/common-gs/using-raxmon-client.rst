The Rackspace Monitoring command-line interface (CLI), known as raxmon, lets
you interact with the |apiservice| in a quick and
efficient manner. If you're not a programmer, consider using raxmon to
become familiar with the product and its capabilities. Even if you have
programming experience, you might like the speed at which you can set up
monitors by using the Rackspace Monitoring client.

You can use the client for this tutorial by installing and running it from
local workstation, not on the servers that you plan to monitor.


..  note::
      Raxmon is not designed to work on a Windows OS.
