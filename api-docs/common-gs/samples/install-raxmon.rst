Installing the client
---------------------

Follow these steps to install raxmon on your local workstation if you
don't already have a version installed.

If you have an earlier version installed, upgrade to version 0.4.6 or
later. See the `Rackspace Monitoring CLI GitHub repository`_ for the most
current version.

Before you install raxmon, you must have Python version 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7
installed on your local computer (the computer on which you will install
raxmon).

.. important::

   Raxmon is not supported on a Windows OS.


To install the Rackspace monitoring client, complete the following steps:

#. Log in to a bash shell on your local workstation as the user who has
   write permissions to ``/usr/local/bin``.

#. To install the client, run the following command:
   .. code::

       $ sudo pip install rackspace-monitoring-cli
