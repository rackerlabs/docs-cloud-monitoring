=======================
General API information
=======================

The Rackspace Monitoring API is implemented by using a RESTful web service
interface. Cloud Big Data shares a common token-based authentication system
with other products in the Rackspace Cloud suite. This system enables seamless
access between Rackspace products and services.

.. note::

   All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using
   HTTPS on TCP port 443. For authentication instructions, see
   :ref:`Authenticate to the Rackspace Cloud <authenticate-to-cloud>`.

.. COMMENT: The topics in the toctree vary based on the API being documented.
