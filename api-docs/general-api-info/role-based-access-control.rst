Role based access control (RBAC)
================================

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to the capabilities of
Rackspace Cloud services, including the Rackspace Monitoring API,
to authorized users only. RBAC enables Rackspace Cloud customers to
specify which account users of their Cloud account have access to which
Rackspace Monitoring API service capabilities, based on roles
defined by Rackspace. The permissions to perform certain operations in
the |apiservice| – create, read, update, delete – are assigned to specific
roles. The account owner assigns these roles, either multiproduct
(global) or product-specific (for example, Rackspace Monitoring only) to
account users.


Assigning roles to account users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The account owner (identity:user-admin) can create account users on the account
and then assign roles to those users. The roles grant the account users
specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the next gen Cloud
Servers service. Each account has only one account owner, and that role is
assigned by default to any Rackspace Cloud account when the account is created.

See the Cloud Identity API guide for information about how to perform the
following tasks:

* :rax-devdocs:`Add account users <cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/users-operations/#add-user>`

* :rax-devdocs:`Add role to user \
  <cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/role-operations/#add-role-to-user>`

* :rax-devdocs:`Delete global role from user \
  <cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/role-operations/#delete-global-role-from-user>`

For information about implementing RBAC by using the Cloud Control Panel
and other RBAC-related topics, see the following articles in the Rackspace Support
how-to collection:

.. _monitoring-rbac:

Roles available for |product name|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the roles that can be used to access the
|product name| API.

.. list-table:: **Product roles and capabilities**
   :widths: 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role name
     - Role permissions
   * - monitoring:admin
     - This role provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete permissions
       in |product name|, where access is granted.
   * - monitoring:creator
     - This role provides Create, Read, and Update permissions in
       |product name|, where access is granted.
   * - monitoring:observer
     - This role provides Read permission in |product name|, where access
       is granted.

Multiproduct global roles and permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, two multiproduct roles apply to all products. Users with
multiproduct roles inherit access to products when those products become
RBAC-enabled. The following table describes these roles and their permissions.

.. list-table:: **Multiproduct roles and permissions**
   :widths: 20 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Role name
     - Role permissions
   * - admin
     - This role provides Create, Read, Update, and Delete permissions in all
       products, where access is granted.
   * - observer
     - This role provides Read permission in all products, where access is
       granted.


.. _resolve-rbac-conflicts:

Resolving conflicts between RBAC multiproduct versus custom (product-specific) roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The account owner can set roles for both multiproduct and |product name|
scope, and it is important to understand how any potential conflicts between
these roles are resolved. When two roles appear to conflict, the role that
provides the more extensive permissions takes precedence. Therefore, admin
roles take precedence over observer and creator roles, because admin roles
provide more permissions.

The following table shows two examples of how potential conflicts between user
roles in the Control Panel are resolved.

.. list-table:: **Example of resolving permissions**
   :widths: 10 10 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Permission configuration
     - Control Panel permission view
     - Control Panel admin capabilities
   * - User is assigned the following roles: multiproduct **observer** and
       |product name| **admin**
     - Appears that the user has only the multiproduct **observer** role
     - User can perform admin functions for |product name| only. The user has
       the **observer** role for the rest of the products.
   * - User is assigned to the following roles: multiproduct **admin** and
       |product name| **observer**
     - Appears that the user has only the multiprodcut **admin** role
     - User can perform admin functions for all of the products.
       The |product name| **observer** role is ignored.


.. _rbac-permissions-cross-reference:

RBAC permissions cross-reference to Rackspace Monitoring operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

API operations for Rackspace Monitoring may or may not be available to all
roles. To see which operations are permitted to invoke which calls,
review the
:how-to:`Detailed permissions matrix for Rackspace Monitoring <detailed-permissions-matrix-for-rackspace-monitoring>`
article.
