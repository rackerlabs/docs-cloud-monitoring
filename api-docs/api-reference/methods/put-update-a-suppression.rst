Update a suppression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    PUT /suppressions/{suppressionId}

Updates the suppression specified by the ``suppressionId``.

You can complete partial updates for a suppression. When you submit
the request only include values for the attributes you want to update.
The values on omitted parameters are not updated. Note that updating
a list completely replaces the previous list. Refer to the
:ref:`suppressions attributes <suppressions-operations>`
table.

.. note::
   Keep the following points in mind when updating a suppression:

   * Until the start_time, you can modify any field on the suppression;
     however, after that time has passed and the suppression has begun
     only the end_time can be updated.
   * The end_time can only be set to 0 or a time in the future.
     As with the start_time, there is an allowance of 60 seconds made to
     account for the time it takes to receive and process a request.
     This means that if the provided end_time is less than 60 seconds in
     the past, it will be considered to be now instead of causing a
     validation error. If you want the suppression to end immediately,
     set the end_time to 0.
