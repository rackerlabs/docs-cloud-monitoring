.. _list-metrics-by-check-id:

List metrics by check ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    GET /entities/{entityId}/checks/{checkId}/metrics

Lists the metrics associated with the specified ``checkId``.

This operation can be paginated. For information,
see :ref:`Paginated collections <paginated-collections>`.

This operation does not require a request body.

This operation returns a response body that lists the metrics associated
with your check. A single check usually generates several metrics.
For example, http checks generate the following metrics: bytes, code,
duration, truncated, tt_connect, tt_firstbyte.

Metrics generated by remote checks are generated for each monitoring
zone where the check is issued.

Metric names use the syntax:

``monitoringZone``.``metricName``

where:

``monitoringZone``
  is the monitoring zone where the check was issued.

``metricName``
  is the name of the metric.

For example a metric called ``tt_connect``, generated from the ``dfw``
monitoring zone, is labeled as ``mzdfw.tt_connect``.

.. note::
   Metrics generated by agent checks have no monitoring zone.
