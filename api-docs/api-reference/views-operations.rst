Views
=====

Views contain a combination of data that usually includes
multiple, different objects. The primary purpose of a view is
to save API calls and make data retrieval more efficient. Instead of
doing multiple API calls and then combining the result yourself,
you can perform a single API call against the view endpoint.

Use the following views API operations to manage alarm views.
