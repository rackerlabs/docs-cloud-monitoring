Service updates
===============

Rackspace provides service updates to introduce backward-compatible updates and
modifications to |apiservice| |contract version|. These changes are not
intended to break any existing code that relies on the API (SDK, web
applications, scripts, and so on). However, you might want to update or extend
your code to use new features and enhancements.

Features or functionality changes that would necessitate a break in
API-compatibility will require a new version, which will result in URI
version being updated accordingly. When new API versions are released,
older versions will be marked as ``DEPRECATED``. Providers should work
with developers and partners to ensure there is adequate time to migrate to
the new version before deprecated versions are discontinued.

To learn about updates and changes included in this and other releases, see the
:ref:`Release Notes <release-notes-collection>`.
