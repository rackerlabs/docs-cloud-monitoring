Resolved issues
---------------

The following agent-specific changes were made:

- Fixed a bug in the socket timeout logic found for service net
  monitoring agents (including DBaaS).

- Fixed a bug on service net reconnects.

- Improved the hostinfo infrastructure for future releases.

- Updated various components within Luvit for improved stability.

- Added fixes for hostinfo and disabling prelink on RPM systems.

- Added a fix for the RPM packaging for the previous 2.1.16 release.

- Fixed an issue with Ubuntu 15.04 and systemd registration across reboots.

- Upgraded an underlying library (libuv) that the agent uses for asynchronous

  potentially cause performance issues with file system operations.
