and concepts. To use the |apiservice| effectively, you should understand the
following key concepts:

Monitoring key terms and concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _account-def:

 **Account**

    An account contains attributes describing a customer's account,
    including the Id. The account description contains mostly read-only
    data; however, a few properties can be modified with the API, such
    as the ``metadata`` and ``webhook_token``. For more information, see
    :ref:`Update properties on an account <update-properties-on-an-account>`.

.. _alarm-and-alerts-def:

 **Alarm and alert**

    An alarm contains a set of rules that determine when the monitoring
    system sends an alert through a configured notification. You can
    create multiple alarms for the different checks associated with an
    entity, though each alarm you create will be associated with a
    single check. For example, if your entity is a web server that hosts
    your company's website, you can create one alarm to monitor the
    server itself, and another alarm to monitor the website.

    When an alarm is triggered it alerts the associated notification
    plan to send notifications. This process is called the "alerting
    workflow."

    The alarm language lets you pinpoint the value that will trigger
    the alarm. To learn how to use the alarm language to create robust
    monitors, see :ref:`Alert Triggering and Alarms <alert-triggers-and-alarms-reference>`.

.. _check-and-check-types-def:

**Check and check type**

    Once you've created an entity, you can configure one or more checks
    for it. A check is the foundational building block of your
    monitoring configuration, and is always associated with an entity.
    The check specifics the parts or pieces of the entity that you want
    to collect data from, the collection frequency, how many monitoring
    zones are launching the check, and so on.

    You can associate one or more checks with an entity. In order to
    monitor a resource, an entity must have at least one check, but by
    creating multiple checks for an entity, you can monitor several
    different aspects of a single resource.

    For each check you create, you designate a check type. The check
    type specifies what kind of data to collect, PING, HTTP, SMTP, and
    so on. There are are two major check types: remote and agent.
    Rackspace Monitoring check types are fully described in the
    :ref:`Check types <check-type-operations>` section.

    Note that checks only gather metrics. A check specifies what data
    are collected and how they are collected; it does not trigger an
    alert, or a notification action. Instead, alerts are triggered by
    alarms based on your notification configuration.

.. _entity-concept:
 
**Entity**

    In Rackspace Monitoring, an entity is the object or resource
    that you want to monitor. Entities are automatically created for for
    the Rackspace products that have monitoring integration, like
    Cloud Servers and Cloud Databases. You can also create entities
    yourself. For more information, see the API operations reference for the
    :ref:`entity <entities-operations>`
    resource.

.. _gloss-id:

**ID or Id**

    All objects in the monitoring system are identified by a uniquely
    generated identifier, generally expressed as Id, that consists of a
    two-character type prefix followed by a string of alphanumeric
    characters. You use an object's Id when you want to perform
    operations on it. For example, when you want to create a check and
    associate it with an entity, you must know the entity's Id.

.. _metric-concepts:
 
**Metric, cumulative and instantaneous**

    A metric is a measurement of activity or state on a monitored
    resource. Checks gather metrics and send them to the monitoring
    system. Based on your configurations, a set of metrics may trigger
    an alarm, causing an alert to be sent. Metrics can also be used to
    create graphs.

    For more information, see the API operations reference information for
    :ref:`Cumulative and instantaneous metrics <cumulative-metrics>`.

.. _monitoring-agent-concept:
  
**Monitoring agent**

    The monitoring agent provides insight into the internal workings of
    your servers with checks for information such as load average and
    network usage. It complements the availability data you can gather
    with the remote checks types. The agent operates as a single small
    service that runs checks that you configure and pushes metrics to
    the rest of Rackspace Monitoring so that the metrics can be analyzed,
    alerted on, and archived. These metrics are gathered via checks
    using specified agent check types, and can be used with the other
    Rackspace Monitoring features such as alarms. See
    :rax-devdocs:`Agent check types <cm/api/v1.0/cm-devguide/content/appendix-check-types-agent.html>`
    for a list of agent check types.

    To learn about installing and configuring monitoring agents, read the
    :ref:`Install and configure <install-and-configure>` section.

.. _zones:
 
**Monitoring zone**

    When you create a remote check, you specify which monitoring zone(s)
    you want to launch the check from. A monitoring zone is the point of
    origin or "launch point" of the check. This concept of a monitoring
    zone is similar to that of a datacenter, however in the monitoring
    system, you can think of it more as a geographical region.

    You can launch checks for a particular entity from multiple monitoring zones. This
    allows you to observe the performance of an entity from different regions of the
    world. It is also a way to prevent noisy alarms. For example, if the check from one
    monitoring zone reports that an entity is down, a second or third monitoring
    zone might report that the entity is up and running. This gives you a better picture
    of an entity's overall health.

.. _notification-and-notification-types:

 **Notification and notification type**

    A notification is a rule specifying how and to whom an informational
    message should be sent when an alarm is triggered. You can set up
    of the notification rules are determined by the specified
    notification type. Rackspace Monitoring currently supports
    webhooks, email, PagerDuty, SMS, and VictorOps notification types
    for sending notifications.

.. _notify-plan-def:

 **Notification plan**

    A notification plan contains a set of notification rules to execute
    when an alarm is triggered. A notification plan can contain multiple
    notifications for each of the following states:

    -  Critical

    -  Warning

    -  OK

 .. _gloss-suppress:

 **Suppression**
    Once you've set up your monitoring to your satisfaction, there may
    come a point when you don't want to receive notifications for a set
    time period (e.g. a period of scheduled maintenance). In this
    situation, you can choose to set up a suppression. A suppression
    silences the notifications from an alarm or a set of alarms for a
    given amount of time. For more details and examples, see the API operation
    reference for the :ref:`suppressions <suppressions-operations>` resource.


.. _how-cloud-monitoring-works:

How Rackspace Monitoring works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace Monitoring helps you track all your resources; from
websites to web servers, routers, load balancers, and more. The
following image illustrates a basic monitoring workflow.
 
**Figure: Rackspace Monitoring workflow**

.. image::  ../_images/Rackspace_monitor_svc_image6.png
    :alt: Rackspace Monitoring workflow

#. You create an entity to represent the item that you want to monitor.
   For example, the entity might represent a website or web server.

#. You attach a predefined check to the entity. For example, you could
   use the remote.http check to monitor your website's connectivity. You
   can run your checks from multiple monitoring zones to provide
   redundant monitoring. You can also use voting logic to reduce
   noisiness.

#. You create notifications (a message sent to one or more addresses)
   and notification plans (a set of notifications). For example, you
   might create a notification to specify that Cloud Monitoring send an
   email when a specific condition is met.

#. You define one or more alarms for each check and associate the
   notification plan with the alarm. The alarm configuration specifies
   the conditions under which the metrics returned by the check will
   trigger the alarm. When the configured condition is met, the alarm is
   triggered and the associated notification plan is put into action.
   For example, your alarm might specify an HTTP response code. If this
   code is returned, the alarm sends you an email, or sends a webhook to
   a URL.


 .. _agent-works:

How the monitoring agent works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace Monitoring also provides the optional Monitoring Agent which you
install on the servers you want to monitor. While Rackspace Monitoring can
poll your servers from multiple data centers, the agent gathers
information locally on the server. The agent gathers:

-  Host information regarding network configuration, process tables, and
   disks to stay current with frequent system configuration changes.

-  Host metrics such as swap, CPU, disk, filesystem, and network device
   usage.

Some examples of agent checks include:

-  Memory

-  CPU

-  Disk

-  Network

-  Custom (user-definable plug-ins able to monitor any process or
   statistic on a server or from an application)

The :ref:`Install and configure <install-and-configure>` section tells you how
to get the Monitoring Agent up and running.
