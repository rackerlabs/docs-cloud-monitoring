Creating a notification plan 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A notification represents a single action, such as sending an email to a
specific address, whereas a notification plan represents a set of
actions. Assuming the ID of the notification that you created is
``nt2T8WtWte``, following is an example of how you might specify the
attributes for a notification plan:

label
    Specifies a descriptive name for the notification plan.

warning\_state
    Specifies a list of notification IDs to send when the state is
    WARNING.

critical\_state
    Specifies a list of notification IDs to send when the state is
    CRITICAL.

ok\_state
    Specifies a list of notification IDs to send when the state is OK.

In this case, you're configuring the system to send an email when a
state changes.

 
**Example: Create a notification plan, request: cURL**

.. code::

    curl -i -X POST \
    --data-binary \
    '{
          "label": "Notification Plan 1",
          "warning_state": [
              "nt2T8WtWte"
          ],
          "critical_state": [
              "nt2T8WtWte"
          ],
          "ok_state": [
             "nt2T8WtWte"
          ]
    }' \

header that contains the URL of the new notification plan, the
notification plan was created. If the notification plan was not created,
an error is returned.
