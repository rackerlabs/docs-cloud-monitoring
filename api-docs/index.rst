Rackspace Monitoring |contract version|
=======================================

*Last updated:* |today|

The Rackspace Monitoring API service enables developers to analyze cloud
services and dedicated infrastructure through a simple Representational State
Transfer (REST) web service interface.

The API currently supports monitoring for external services. The key benefits
you receive from using the Rackspace Monitoring API include the following:

- **Use of Domain Specific Language (DSL)**

  The Rackspace Monitoring API uses a DSL, which makes it a
  powerful tool for configuring advanced monitoring features. For
  example, typically complex tasks, such as defining triggers on
  thresholds for metrics or performing an inverse string match become
  much easier with a concise, special purpose language created for
  defining alarms. For alarm concept information, see :ref:`Alarm and
  alert <concepts>`.

- **Monitoring from Multiple Datacenters**

  Rackspace Monitoring allows you to simultaneously monitor the performance of
  different resources from multiple datacenters and provides a clear picture
  of overall system health. It includes tunable parameters to interpret mixed
  results which help you to create deliberate and accurate alerting policies.
  For more information, see :ref:`Alert Policies <alert-policies-and-types>`.


- **Alarms and Notifications**

  When an alarm occurs on a monitored resource, Rackspace Monitoring sends you
  a notification so that you can take the appropriate action to either prevent
  an adverse situation from occurring or rectify a situation that has already
  occurred. These notifications are sent based on the severity of the alert as
  defined in the notification plan. For more information, see
  :ref:`Notifications <notification-plans-operations>`.


- **Collection of Data**

  Rackspace Monitoring allows you to collect a variety of data
  that you can use for other tasks, such as researching trends or
  measuring critical data. For more information, see
  :ref:`Metrics <metrics-operations>`.

This guide is intended to assist software developers who want to develop
applications by using the REST application programming interface (API) for
the |product name| service.

To use the information provided here, you should have a general understanding
of the service and have access to an installation of it. You should also be
familiar with the following technologies:

- RESTful web services
- HTTP/1.1
- JSON serialization formats
- Other Rackspace services applicable to your cloud application
  architecture (Cloud Servers, Cloud Load Balancers, Cloud Databases,
  and so forth)
